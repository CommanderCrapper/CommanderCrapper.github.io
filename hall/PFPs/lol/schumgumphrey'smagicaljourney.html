    <!--Maybe add old sketches for designs on the website here? I really want the secret part of the website to be rewarding in one way or another, not just a one-&-done joke of "haha you found the secret page!"
    
    I might honestly just do the old sketches idea, since it'd be cool behind-the-scenes as a special reward. But I also need a good way to hide all of this.
    
    Probably just hide it under /hall/pfps, since it's the furthest deep directory? but I could also hide it under .vscode, I just don't know if the commit message will update for .vscode & ultimately make it pointless (by being extremely obvious)
    
    Actually if I make a commit message that's not extremely obvious it might pass? because honestly, who checks .vscode in repos anyway? (unless I'm just being stupid)
    
    Actually I don't even think .vscode will count as a directory. fuck.
    
    whatever. Moving it to pfps. Gonna edit the message accordingly >.>;-->
