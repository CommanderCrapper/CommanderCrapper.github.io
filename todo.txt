LIST OF SHIT I STILL NEED TO DO:

1. Figure out why the audio hasn't been working this entire time, & a way to fix it
2. Add list of credits to people who also had a part in making the website (mudsock, all the artists that made my PFPs, etc.) (FINISHED)
3. Fix weird warping of "About Me!" window on the about me section (FINISHED)
4. Maybe link to github? Or socials? (What would be a REALLY cool idea is to do it as buttons on the main page) (FINISHED, looks really great B)
5. Replace all placeholder copyrighted imagery with different, non-copyrighted photos (FINISHED? STILL NEED TO REPLACE INTRO MUSIC WITH SMTH ORIGINAL)
6. Replace all the fonts so they fit the aesthetic more (FINISHED, KINDA)
7. Once everything is finished, upload code to neocities, test it out to make sure neocities doesn't screw anything up

--BONUS--
8. Once everything is done, learn react & implement actual stuff into it.



OK NEW TODO LIST LESSGO

1. Add more items to the list
2. Add a little note that clarifies that this website is best experienced on PC, mobile & handheld devices are not accounted for
3. Ok something cool I just thought of, it'd be really neat to have a windows XP-styled loading screen with a custom logo for the website
if i'm gonna do this idea I need to make sure there's some sort of check that it's the first time someone's loading the main page, bc it'd be kinda annoying to wait through a loading screen every single time the main page is loaded; my first thought is there's a ticker that clears on page exit? like, one you close completely out of the tab, it resets back to 0, but once it hits 1 (meaning the page has gone through the initial "boot sequence"), it won't ever show again until the page is refreshed.

4. Eventually, at some point I do want to add a footer that's just an image of the Windows XP taskbar so it doesn't feel as strange; but I'm not sure if that would kinda ruin the immersion? Since the bar would have effectively no functionality
