    <!--Who even am I?-->
    <h3 class="whoamI"> So who even is the "Commander Crapper?"</h3>
    <p>A question I ask myself a little too often at times. I'm a commander who's crappier than them all, here for a good time. Overall just a dude on the internet amongst a sea of other people, finding a passion in computer science &amp; just living life as it goes by. Nothing super interesting, I know, but that's essentially it.</p>

    <!--Likes/interests-->
    <h3 class="Interests">Interests</h3>
    <ul>Computer science (learning HTML/CSS, planning to learn Javascript in a different framework)</ul>
    <ul>Drums (playing for ~2, 2 1/2 years now)</ul>
    <ul>Music (Old/2000's rock, jazz, metal, etc.)</ul>
    <ul>Videogames (I don't really have a preference for specific genres, I've played a lot of masterpieces from many different genres so I don't really mind as long as it's fun)</ul>
    <ul>2000's nostalgia of any kind (I'm mostly into the goofier culture &amp; simpler times of the 2000's, something about it is just so memorable &amp; incredible to me)</ul>


    <!--Future goals-->
    <h3 class="Goals">Future Goals &amp; Plans</h3>
    <ul>Get more into computer science, learn more languages (possibly languages that are more computer-based that have a heavier emphasis on background work, like software &amp; programs such as wallpaper engine or malwarebytes.)</ul> <br>
    <ul>Start a band (if it's not a tribute band to several memorable &amp; older bands, then I'd like to be in a band that makes original music, preferably rock/jazz)</ul> <br>
    <ul>Becoming an author I guess would be cool?</ul> <br>
