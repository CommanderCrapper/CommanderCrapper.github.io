    <p> Hello! My name's Commander Crapper. I am an absolute idiot &amp; basically make it everyone's problem. I'm learning to code so I can potentially find a future career as a developer or some sort of freelance programmer, as well as potentially learn about internet technician stuff so I could have a future in that as well. With that said;<br>
      This is a test website I made to get used to working with HTML &amp; CSS. I intend on adding more interactivity in the (hopefully) near future, however at the moment I am figuring out my grounding. Don't expect everything to have crazy optimization up the ass with stuff like buttons, different pages, or even graphic design beyond relatively basic stuff. (You can, however, potentially see that in the future, if I'm able to get good enough to code such things. But I'll cross that bridge when I get there)</p> <br> <br>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
  <ul>Drums (have been playing for roughly ~2, maybe 2 &amp; a half years now)</ul>
  <ul>Music (like 70's-90's rock/metal &amp; whatnot, 2000's rock, jazz, etc.)</ul>
  <ul>Computer Science (I'm learning HTML, CSS, &amp; trying to remember Javascript lol)</ul>
  <ul>Casual biking (not competitive/working out)</ul>
  <ul>Videogames (any type really, I've played a lot of good games from individual genres)</ul> <br> <br>

    <h2>Here's some cool people I know</h2>
